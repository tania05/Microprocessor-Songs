# Microprocessor-Songs
A project done on Atmel SAM3U2 processor for playing , shuffling, slowing down the temp of the songs. One of the songs is "Thrift store" by Macklemore and the other one is "Smoke on the water" by Deep Purple.
I am working on a new method that will allow the user to record their own music and play it back. Navigate into Microprocessor songs and execute "mpgl1-efmw-01.eww" file.

For the demo, please watch my video of the project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIS51Emg8mE

Have patience for more cool things! :)

P.S- I have the minimum knowledge about music and notes , please excuse any missing/ incorrect beats/notes!
